# TweetNest – Simple Social Media Clone

TweetNest is a basic front-end social media clone . The layout is divided into three sections: a left sidebar for navigation, a middle section for posts and interactions, and a right sidebar for user information and suggestions.

Users can view posts, like posts, and add comments dynamically using JavaScript. The project focuses on UI structure, basic interactivity, and understanding how a social media platform is organized at a beginner level.
